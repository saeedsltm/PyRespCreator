# PyRespCreator
PyRespCreator is a Python utility for managing seismic station metadata and generating response files from user-provided sensor & digitizer files in JSON format. The script supports tasks such as converting dataless SEED files to JSON or STATION0.HYP format and creating station directories with required response information in three different formats (XML, SC, RESP).
